---

## OUR VISION

## OUR APPROACH

### WHO WE WORK WITH

We work with very driven principals and School Governing Bodies that are eagerly waiting for the perfect infrastructure to help their school's learners and teachers jump onto and/or stay on the Digital Train.

### WHAT WE FOCUS ON

We believe that amongst some of the critical things that school leaders care about are:

- Improving learning and the pass rate
- Motivating teachers and learners to fulfill their daily tasks
- Reducing absenteeism and getting learners to remain at school
- Saving money and/or ensuring adequacy of budget

### HOW WE DELIVER

When we deliver our digital infrastructure and mobile data products to schools, learners, and teachers, they will experience at least a 75% improvement in their ability to access the internet and other digital products but at significant cost savings.

### WHY WE DO IT

We believe that access to and the ability to use digital technologies is super critical for every learner and teacher and cannot see why the infrastructure to achieve this goal should not be available at every South African school at very affordable pricing.
